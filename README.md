# CoderX
A proof-of-concept AI sytstem by [Graham Neubig](http://phontron.com) (June 30, 2021).

## About CoderX

CoderX is a retrieval-based code generation AI system reminiscent of [Hayati et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10025)
(2018) or [Hashimoto et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01194) (2018). However, compared to these methods, CoderX uses
a highly-sophisticated sequence-to-sequence model based on introspection-based learning to remove content that may be
harmful to the usability of the code in certain application scenarios, such as inconvenient licensing restrictions.

## Usage

The usage of CoderX is simple, if you specify a github repository, CoderX will generate code that has very similar or
identical functionality as that github repository. However, because it was generated by an AI system, it fortunately
belongs to you, is not encumbered by copyright, and can be used for any purpose you want. Use it as follows:

    python coderx.py [address of github repo]

As a result, the retrieved repository will exist in the current directory, and the generated code will exist in a
directory of the same name with `_coderx` appended to the end.

## License

CoderX is licensed under the JSON license, which basically means you can use it for anything but evil. Unless you use
CoderX on itself of course, in which case you can get a library with similar functionality not encumbered by this pesky
"do no evil" clause.
